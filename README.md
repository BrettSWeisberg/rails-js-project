## Project Name: rails-js-project

## Project Overview:
This project is a project management site specifically for a design studio that has many clients. Clients have many projects, both of which are assigned a manager who oversees them. This is the third iteration of the site, which has the most advanced code thus far, which includes JavaScript and APIs.

## Motivation:
Currently, the company that this site is designed for uses Excel files to manage their project management needs. The current situation will soon become unmanageable.

## Build Status:
The site is still a work in progress and future iterations will include a more built out CSS structure. The focus for the site up to this point has been to build out the needed functionality and to customize the UI at a later date.

## Framework:
The site built with Rails and JavaScript.

## Features:
- Utilized the bcrypt gem to improve site security
